#so it's the problem of largest connected component
#unfortunately, searching for anything like this 
#question is swamped by people asking for answers 
#for this puzzle specifically, so looking for
#fruitful potential approaches is difficult

#one approach: sort rabbits/nodes into unwarrened,
#has-nudged, and warrened-but-has-not-nudged
#for each warren/component, track how many 
#of the rabbits are yet to nudge
#this could be useful for memoization
#but there ought to be a better way
#wait, there will never be a warren with more than 
#one nudge available. that simplifies things
